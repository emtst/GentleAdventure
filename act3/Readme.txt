Act III: Processes and coinduction, properties of Smol-Zooid's global types.

In its third part, the tutorial will show how we have formalised
communication discipline in Coq: we will discuss how we get semantics
guarantees from multiparty session types. Global and local types are
coinductively described in Coq, and, through labelled transition
systems, we show that execution traces for processes are subtraces of
the global protocol ones.
