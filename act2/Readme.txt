Act II: Smol-Zooid: multiparty with shallower embedding.

In the second part, we discuss how to avoid problems with binders, by
using a mixed deep/shallow embedding. We present Smol-Zooid, a process
calculus for multiparty computations, its semantics and a typing
relation that associates processes with their concurrent behaviour.
